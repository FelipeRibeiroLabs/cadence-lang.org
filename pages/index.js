                <h3><FcLock/> Safety by design</h3>
                <p>
                  Cadence provides security and safety guarantees that greatly simplify the development of secure smart contracts.
                </p>
                <p>
                  As smart contracts often deal with valuable assets, Cadence provides the resource-oriented programming paradigm,
                  which guarantees that assets can only exist in one location at a time, cannot be copied, and cannot be accidentally lost or deleted.
                  With <a href="https://developers.flow.com/cadence/language/resources">resources</a>,
                  digital assets are first-class citizens, making their accidental loss or malicious duplication impossible.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Cadence includes several language features which prevent entire classes of bugs.
                  For example, it accomplishes this via a strong static type system, <a href="https://developers.flow.com/cadence/language/functions#function-preconditions-and-postconditions">design by contract</a>,
                  and <a href="https://developers.flow.com/cadence/language/capability-based-access-control">capability-based access control</a>.
                </p>
                <p>
                  These security and safety features allow smart contract developers to focus on the business logic of their contract,
                  instead of preventing accidents and attacks.

                <p>
                  Cadence enables composability.
                </p>
                <p>
                  <a href="https://developers.flow.com/cadence/language/resources">Resources</a> are stored directly in users' accounts,
                  and can flow freely between contracts:
                  They can be passed as arguments to functions, returned from functions, or even combined in arbitrary data structures.
                  This makes implementing business logic easier, more natural and promotes reuse of existing logic.
                </p>
                <p>
                  <a href="https://developers.flow.com/cadence/language/interfaces">Interfaces</a> allow contracts and resources to expose functionality
                  to other programs, and allows them to use other programs, enabling an organic ecosystem of programs that interoperate with each other.
                  By using interfaces, developers can easily integrate their applications into existing ecosystems,
                  and invite and support future applications into it.
                </p>
                <p>
                  In addition, the <a href="https://developers.flow.com/cadence/language/attachments">attachments</a> feature
                  of Cadence allows developers to extend existing types with new functionality and data,
                  without requiring the original author of the type to plan or account for the intended behavior.

                <p>
                  Cadence's syntax is inspired by popular modern general-purpose programming languages like Swift, Kotlin, and Rust,
                  so developers will find the syntax and the semantics familiar.
                  Practical tooling, <a href="https://developers.flow.com/cadence/language">documentation</a>,
                  and examples enable developers to start creating programs quickly and effectively.

              <div>
                <h3><FcChargeBattery/> Powerful Transactions</h3>
                <p>
                  In Cadence, a transaction has a lot more flexibility and the power to perform multiple operations with a single transaction,
                  as opposed to multiple, separate smart contract calls like in other languages.
                  It allows complex, multi-step interactions to be one-click user experiences.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Developers can easily batch multiple transactions, turning complicated user journeys into a few clicks.
                  For example, imagine approving and completing the listing of an NFT from a new collection in the same transaction,
                  or adding and sending funds with just one approval.

                <p>
                  To further enhance the developer experience, there is also a
                  native testing framework, which allows developers to write
                  unit & integration tests using Cadence. The framework can
                  also generate code coverage insights.
